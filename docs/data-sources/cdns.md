```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Read-Only

- `cdns` (Attributes List) List of all CDNs (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cdns))

<a id="nestedatt--cdns"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cdns`

Read-Only:

- `cnames` (Set of String) CNAME assigned to CDN. CNAME should be mapped via DNS to CDN URL. Otherwise it's not possible to generate an SSL certificate for any related CNAME.
- `creation_time` (String) Timestamp when CDN was created
- `id` (Number) ID of the CDN. This is also used as the CDN URL
- `label` (String) The label helps you to identify your CDN
- `mp4_pseudo_streaming_enabled` (Boolean) Turn this option on if using a flash-based video player with MP4 files. Pseudo-streaming is used mainly in flash players. HTML5 players use range-requests. When enabled the "query_string" option must be set to ignore all parameters.
- `note` (String) Optional note
- `origin_id` (String) ID (UUID) of attached Origin (content source for CDN)
- `url` (String) URL of the CDN. Automatically generated when the CDN is created. The number is the same as the CDN ID.
